<div class="section" id="once-upon-a-time">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Once Upon A Time</a></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, I was a happy <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github</a> user.  However these
were the days before github pages, <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/">travis-ci</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.org/">readthedocs</a> (or, if they
existed, I didn't know about them).  I needed to have some other service to
host my blog, do my continuous integration testing, and host my software's
built documentation.  After looking around for options I decided that I was
just going to host them myself using <a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins</a>, and some home-grown
post-commit hooks to build and move the documentation to my web server.</p>
<p>Since I was going to be hosting some of my own applications anyway, I started
wondering if I should replace github with my own git repository mirror and
issue tracker.  I don't remember all my thoughts that went into that decision,
but I do remember holding many of the opinions expressed <a class="reference external" href="http://bytbox.net/blog/2012/08/leaving-github.html">here</a>.  Particularly I
remember being disatisifed with github's pull requests being incompatible with
git's pull requests (an opinion shared by others, including <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674">Linus Torvalds</a>).  I also remember seeing a few features in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redmine.org/">redmine</a> that were not available in github's issue tracker, but I don't remember now what those features were.</p>
<p>I also suffer from the affliction of being fiercly independent.  Why let
someone else host my stuff when I am perfectly capable of doing it on my own?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="self-hosted-solution">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Self-hosted Solution</a></h2>
<p>So, I decided to move to an entirely self-hosted solution.  Well, not
&quot;entirely&quot;.  I had it all set up on a linode, not my own hardware, but apart
from that I did it all myself.  I hosted the git repositories using <a class="reference external" href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/">gitolite</a>
and provided a browser view to them using <a class="reference external" href="http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a>.  I set up a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redmine.org/">redmine</a> issue
tracker and had a <a class="reference external" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins</a> continuous integration server, that were both
tightly coupled to the git repositories containing the code they were
interested in.  I had my own <a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a> instance to host my blog (which I
eventually ditched for <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a>).  I even eventually had my own instance of
<a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.org/">readthedocs</a> to automatically build the documentation.  And all of this was
hosted using <a class="reference external" href="http://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">uwsgi</a>.</p>
<p>It was a pretty sweet setup.  It took several months to get setup, but by the
end it was awesome.  But it was also fragile.</p>
<p>I initially tried to set it up on <a class="reference external" href="http://centos.org/">centos</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/">debian</a>, but I couldn't get
redmine to work in uwsgi on either of those.  I finally tried again using
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.archlinux.org/">archlinux</a> and was able to get it working.  This worked great for a while, but
the redmine/uwsgi setup would break about once a month after updating the box,
even when updating packages that didn't seem like they'd matter to the setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reflecting-on-the-choice">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Reflecting on the Choice</a></h2>
<p>I had just finished fixing the redmine/uwsgi setup again after an update from
archlinux when I realized something.  I had just spent all of my free time for
the day fixing my software infrastructure instead of doing what I really wanted
to do, which was work on one of my software applications.  I pondered the
situation over the next few days, and eventually decided to abandon my setup
and move to a less self-hosted plan.  I do not regret my earlier decision to go
self-hosted because I learned a lot about various technologies and about
myself, but I am definitely ready for something else.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I learned, in no particular order.  Maybe they will
help other people make their own decision, but at least they will remind me of
how I felt when I get the itch to do it myself in a few months or years.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>I would much rather spend my time developing my software applications than
maintaining my software infrastructure.</strong> I had come to this conclusion
before when it came to Linux distributions and window managers vs. desktop
environments, but it applies to this as well.</li>
<li><strong>I hate deploying ruby/rails apps.</strong>  The php and C applications I deployed
were all very simple to setup, but the ruby/rails applications were much
harder to do and much more fragile.  The python applications I tried were
also a challenge, but they didn't seem near as bad as the ruby ones.  Maybe I
just need more experience, but my current thinking is I will never host my
own ruby application ever again.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="back-to-github">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Back to Github</a></h2>
<p>So, here I am, moving back to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github</a>.  I'll do everything I can on github,
like issue tracking and git hosting, and I'll use <a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.org/">readthedocs</a> to host my
documentation and <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/">travis-ci</a> to host my continuous integration testing.  I've
even moved my blog to using github pages.  Hopefully this will be a good
solution for me.  At a minimum it will leave me more time to actually work in
my applications.</p>
