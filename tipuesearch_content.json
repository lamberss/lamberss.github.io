In fact, I don't think it would be a stretch to say that playing them is my favorite pass time by a significant margin. While I only have experience with several versions of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and the closely-related Pathfinder games, I think it is fair to say that I would like any RPG fairly well. I, as they say, am addicted. Recently, due to changes in my personal life, I have been unable to play. While I do not regret the change in my personal life, and I would not change it if I could, I do miss my favorite pass time. My group should be getting started again in the next few weeks, but everyone is busy so the start date is later than I would want. So, I started looking for ways to feed my addiction given the constraints of my new life. Asynchronous RPGs There is a way to play games known as \"play-by-post\" (PbP). It can be applied to most board games, and there are several communities on the internet devoted to playing RPGs in this fashion (such as myth-weavers and thetangledweb ). In theory it is similar to playing face-to-face at a table, and like any alternative to anything there are a number of pros and cons. Pros: Asynchronous - You are not playing at the same time, so it is easier to schedule. Instead of blocking out several hours each week to play (and several more to plan if you are the game master), you can spend several minutes a day making your one or two posts for that day. Improved role-playing - Because you have more time to think about your role-playing responses, it is easier to incorporate your character's back story and motivations into your actions. Improved tactical play - Because you have more time to think about your tactical responses, it is easier to make tactically superior choices (or to make tactically inferior choices that are in character ). Improved writing skills - You have to describe everything using words. You cannot mime or make sound effects (although you can link pictures or sound-bites, I suppose). This turns into a lot of practice writing, which turns into better writing. Cons: Pace - Even if you have a pace of two posts per day (aggressive by PbP standards), your game will still take forever to play. Encumbered social interactions - Out-of-character (OOC) conversations are harder to have, and they are not real time, and this is a major drawback. No one else will get excited and jump out of their chair when you land that massive crit, or moan in despair when you miss on a key roll, or laugh like crazy when you come up with that really witty retort. And even if they do these things, you won't know because you aren't there with them. Encumbered tactical play - Tactical play can be encumbered for several reasons. Perhaps the biggest one is that the game master will not be able to update the tactical grid between each player's turn, so it is possible that the thing you say you are attacking when your turn comes around is already dead. Now, I am an aspiring author (or, rather, I aspire to be an aspiring author), so the \"Improved writing skills\" idea is very appealing to me. I definitely don't think I will ever prefer PbP to playing face-to-face, but I do think it might be appealing enough to be worth investigating. So, I decided to try to get into a game. Mama, someone on the internet was mean to me! So, I started keeping tabs on the \"Looking for Games\" forum on thetangledweb . After a few days I found a post for someone wanting to start a D&D 5e game. The GM was a site moderator, so I figured she would be pretty good. (I don't know her gender, and her username is androgynous, but for some reason I think of her as a girl.) I made up a quick character concept and got pulled into the game. The character I came up with was named Casseph \"Mad Cass\" Thorald, and he was a half-elf wild magic sorcerer that was more than a little insane. I was excited! I waited patiently for the game to start, checking the forum several times a day every day for a week. I started to feel let down, but then I did some more poking around and found out that the game had started several days ago and somehow I hadn't been notified. Oh No!!!!! Total rookie mistake. Anyway, I made my post and got my character caught back up. I was totally stoked. \"I'm playing D&D!\" I was thinking to myself. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. Another week goes by and there are no more posts to the game. I am more savvy with the forum so I know I did not miss a post (unless the game moved to a private area and I was deliberately excluded). Furthermore, I can click on the GM's name and see that she hasn't posted anything anywhere on the entire site since the last time she posted in my game. It has now been two weeks with no signs of activity from the GM, and no word about where she has gone or when she is coming back. Internet anonymity strikes again! I find myself wondering what happened to her. Did she get killed, or arrested? I don't know. The sad thing is that this was not my first delve into PbP, but my first attempt ended just as abruptly (although I had posted three or four times before that one died). Conclusion - Do not rely on systems with internet anonymity to provide a necessary service, like feeding a gaming addiction. If you want it done right, you have to do it yourself. So, here I am, wallowing in the misery that is not playing my beloved RPGs. I cannot get a real-life game going any quicker than it will get going because I have to wait till everyone else is ready to game. I cannot get a PbP game going because I don't want to run my own game until I have played in one so I can get a better estimate of how big of a time commitment it is, and I have to wait for yet another game to get started by someone else that I don't know and who will likely abandon me. But I need to play RIGHT NOW! Too bad I can't play by myself. Or can I? What would it be like if I played in my own PbP game? We now have a new alternative, so let's look at the pros and cons. Pros: Everything happens on my schedule Everything is orchestrated by one mind, so there is no game timing conflict. I don't have to worry about taking my turn out of order because all of the turns are my turn. This should make the game run much more like a real novel . I get to control all the characters, so I can explore stories where only one of them is the main character instead of all of them. All the pros for normal PbPs Cons: There are no surprises , at least not in story elements. There will be minor surprises due to randomness, but I will see every single plot-twist coming and I will know all the stats of all the monsters as I am fighting them. As with normal PbPs, there is a lack of social interaction compared to face-to-face games. I personally don't think I will mind the cons that much, especially if I am getting my social needs met in other venues. But did you see the second pro? It will look more like a real novel . And did you remember what I said earlier? I am an aspiring author (or, rather, I aspire to be an aspiring author) One of the reasons that I just aspire to be an aspiring author is that I keep getting stuck because I don't know what to write about. In fact, I have two very specific sources of writer's block: I have trouble deciding names for things and I have trouble writing about plots that I haven't fully thought through (but I cannot fully think them through until I have written about them). If I am running myself through a pre-made RPG module or adventure path, then I am guaranteed not to run into either of these problems because all the people, places, and things will already have names (except the main characters, but that's a one-time cost) and the plot is already outlined in the adventure path. You mean I get to play my beloved RPGs and get practice writing all a the same time? Yes, please! Remember the word \"experiment\"? So, now that you understand the hypothesis, I will explain the experiment. I will be running myself through the Pathfinder Kingmaker adventure path, at least up through the first several encounters. I have chosen Kingmaker because I already own all I need to do to do it, and I am already familiar with the story because I have been a GM for a Kingmaker campaign before. Hopefully I will enjoy myself. Who knows? Clearly I cannot publish anything I write based on modules and adventure paths written by others, but maybe I will be able to take this framework and apply it to my own content in order to actually start writing that book I've been thinking about for almost 20 years.","tags":"Gaming"},{"loc":"https://lamberss.github.io/posts/2014/12/moving-back-to-github","title":"Moving Back to Github","text":"Once Upon A Time Once upon a time, a long time ago, I was a happy github user. However these were the days before github pages, travis-ci , and readthedocs (or, if they existed, I didn't know about them). I needed to have some other service to host my blog, do my continuous integration testing, and host my software's built documentation. After looking around for options I decided that I was just going to host them myself using wordpress , jenkins , and some home-grown post-commit hooks to build and move the documentation to my web server. Since I was going to be hosting some of my own applications anyway, I started wondering if I should replace github with my own git repository mirror and issue tracker. I don't remember all my thoughts that went into that decision, but I do remember holding many of the opinions expressed here . Particularly I remember being disatisifed with github's pull requests being incompatible with git's pull requests (an opinion shared by others, including Linus Torvalds ). I also remember seeing a few features in redmine that were not available in github's issue tracker, but I don't remember now what those features were. I also suffer from the affliction of being fiercly independent. Why let someone else host my stuff when I am perfectly capable of doing it on my own? Self-hosted Solution So, I decided to move to an entirely self-hosted solution. Well, not \"entirely\". I had it all set up on a linode, not my own hardware, but apart from that I did it all myself. I hosted the git repositories using gitolite and provided a browser view to them using cgit . I set up a redmine issue tracker and had a jenkins continuous integration server, that were both tightly coupled to the git repositories containing the code they were interested in. I had my own wordpress instance to host my blog (which I eventually ditched for pelican ). I even eventually had my own instance of readthedocs to automatically build the documentation. And all of this was hosted using nginx and uwsgi . It was a pretty sweet setup. It took several months to get setup, but by the end it was awesome. But it was also fragile. I initially tried to set it up on centos and debian , but I couldn't get redmine to work in uwsgi on either of those. I finally tried again using archlinux and was able to get it working. This worked great for a while, but the redmine/uwsgi setup would break about once a month after updating the box, even when updating packages that didn't seem like they'd matter to the setup. Reflecting on the Choice I had just finished fixing the redmine/uwsgi setup again after an update from archlinux when I realized something. I had just spent all of my free time for the day fixing my software infrastructure instead of doing what I really wanted to do, which was work on one of my software applications. I pondered the situation over the next few days, and eventually decided to abandon my setup and move to a less self-hosted plan. I do not regret my earlier decision to go self-hosted because I learned a lot about various technologies and about myself, but I am definitely ready for something else. Here are some of the things I learned, in no particular order. Maybe they will help other people make their own decision, but at least they will remind me of how I felt when I get the itch to do it myself in a few months or years. I would much rather spend my time developing my software applications than maintaining my software infrastructure. I had come to this conclusion before when it came to Linux distributions and window managers vs. desktop environments, but it applies to this as well. I hate deploying ruby/rails apps. The php and C applications I deployed were all very simple to setup, but the ruby/rails applications were much harder to do and much more fragile. The python applications I tried were also a challenge, but they didn't seem near as bad as the ruby ones. Maybe I just need more experience, but my current thinking is I will never host my own ruby application ever again. Back to Github So, here I am, moving back to github . I'll do everything I can on github, like issue tracking and git hosting, and I'll use readthedocs to host my documentation and travis-ci to host my continuous integration testing. I've even moved my blog to using github pages. Hopefully this will be a good solution for me. At a minimum it will leave me more time to actually work in my applications.","tags":"Computing"}]}
